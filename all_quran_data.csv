To understand the Quran it is necessary that one should know the translation of every word of the verse. Therefore, to convey to the people, the more accurate meaning of the Qur'anic verses, the word-for-word translation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an is produced. Since mere word-for-word translation itself does not lead to the complete understanding, the idiomatic translation is also produced on the same page to facilitate for the complete awareness. To understand the Qur'an, it is necessary that one should know the translation of every word of the Verses. It is very difficult to understand the Qur'an without knowledge of the meanings of the Arabic words. Therefore, to overcome this difficulty and to convey to the people the accurate meaning of the Qur'anic Verses, we are producing the word-for-word translation of the meanings of the Noble Qur’an. Since mere word-for-word translation itself does not lead to complete understanding, we have produced the idiomatic translation also in order to allow the readers to see the word-for-word translation of the Arabic Verses along with the idiomatic one on the same page. I remember from my childhood, when I was studying in the fourth grade, my teacher used to teach us the Qur'an along with its Urdu translation. We studied the necessary interpretation and the Arabic grammar. After about three years of study, I was able to recite on my own the first few parts of the Qur'an while understanding its meaning in the Urdu language. Whenever the Imam recited Verses from those parts in the congregational prayers at the mosque, I easily understood the meaning of the Verses. I felt great joy at being able to understand the recitation of the Imam. This memory initiated me to produce this translation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an so that the readers and reciters of the Qur'an may extract more pleasure from the recitation by understanding its meanings. All the present English translations of the meanings of the Qur’an are idiomatic. Such translations are not designed to help the reader learn the meanings of each Arabic word. Therefore, the readers and reciters simply proceed forward without 'knowledge of the Arabic vocabulary used in the Verses. But when one knows the Meanings of each Arabic word of the Verse, then whether he himself recites the Qur’an, or listens to some other's recitation, he gets the pleasure of understanding it. The real marvel of the Qur'an comes with its understanding. The Qur'an itself emphasizes this point: (Surat Al-Qamar, 54:40) Also Allah has encouraged us to contemplate the meanings of the Qur'an. We receive blessings for its recital, but mere recital alone in melodious tone is not the goal of Qur'anic recitation. The intent of reading the Qur'an should be to reflect upon and understand the address of Allah Himself to mankind. Allah says: ""Do they not then think deeply (contemplate) in the Qur'an, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?"" (Surat Muhammad, 47:24) If one approaches the Qur'an with the intent of reflecting upon its meanings, then he achieves the full objective of the Qur’an’s revelation, which is guidance for mankind. As Allah says: ""The month of Ramadan, in which the Qur’an was revealed as a guidance for mankind."" (Surat Al-Baqarah,2:185) It should also be noted that some Islamic scholars have certain reservations about the word-for-word translation, saying that such a translation may cause confusion in the minds of the readers. But other renowned scholars of the Indo-Pak Subcontinent have produced such translations in the Urdu language. The most popular one being done by Shah Rafiuddin, the son of Shah Waliullah. Until now, this translation is considered the best and the most authentic one. Hafiz Nazeer Ahmad, the former principal of Oriental College, Lahore, performed another recent word-for-word translation in the Urdu language. Some other scholars have also contributed in this regard. It may be that the native speakers of Arabic do not give much importance to the word-for-word translation, but they will know its importance if they ask any non-Arab Muslim about it. This will be especially clear after one has gone through this translation of the Qur’an which we have produced. After studying this translation, the native English speaker will relate how pleased he is with his increased understanding of the Qur'anic recitation. I must thank Mr, Aqeel Walker, Mr. Said Dabas, Mr. Syed Masoodul Hasan, Mr. Mohammad Ayub and Mr. Aziz-ur-Rahman who worked on this project. It should be particularly noted that in this compilation, we have produced with all its references, the translation of the interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an done by Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan. We will be thankful for every comment, suggestion or advice by the readers and reciters of the Qur'an, that may help to improve this presentation. Abdul Malik MujahidGeneral Manager"

So, to help those readers and reciters who are not too familiar with the Arabic language or cannot read Arabic, Darussalam has prepared this edition of the Noble Qur'an inserting the transliteration of the Noble verses along with their translation. It is hoped that this presentation will be of great help and benefit in this regard. All praise and thanks are Allah's, the Lord of Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists) and peace be upon the Master of the Messengers, Muhammad (S). This interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an has been revised and the following changes have been made: Translators: & Islam is a heavenly system (or regime) for all the dwellers of the earth, and it is a mighty treasure if only mankind realizes its authenticity and truth. And in what a great need the whole world is today for real understanding and thorough studying of its rules and regulations. And how many disasters, calamities and wars, the mankind of the whole world is suffering because of their differences in their Faith. Invitation to Islam is incumbent upon all those who have known it, and have enjoyed its taste and have been guided through its guidance. So we are presenting the interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an which is completed and printed with the Help of Allah. All praise and thanks are Allah's, with whose blessings are completed the righteous deeds. Peace. Blessings and Graces of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and his Companions. Allah has sent Qur'an to us through His Messenger Muhammad. This Noble Book provides us guidance in all respects whether it is a matter of life or death. It is incumbent upon us to recite the Noble Qur'an as much as we can, and as correct as we can. The Prophet Muhammad; has said: ""The best of you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it."" So, to learn it correctly and teach it correctly, we have to care about the correct pronunciation of the Arabic words. To provide ease with the correct pronunciation of the Arabic words, we are producing this special edition of the Noble Qur'an incorporating in it the transliteration of the Arabic Verses. It is hoped that this edition will help greatly in this regard. Lastly, I thank all the brothers who participated in the accomplishment of this colossal work particularly brother Abdul Ahad and brother Mohammad Munawar who checked and rechecked, again and again, the manuscript with great perseverance. May Allah the All-Mighty bestow on them a great reward in this world and in the Hereafter. ABDUL MALIK MUJAHID General Manager Darussalam, Publishers and Distributors"

From the back cover: Qatādah (d. 118) said, “By Allah, they would find in the Qurʾan that which would impede sinfulness, if only they contemplated upon it and comprehended it.” [Tafsīr al-Ṭabarī] Al-Shawkānī (d. 1250) said, “Al-Suyūṭī was a major imām and a prolific author. He was given authorization (ijāzah) by the major scholars of his time from different countries and towns. He excelled in the various sciences and surpassed his peers; he gained distinction and his acclaim spread far and wide. From his beneficial works are his two Jāmiʿ collections of ḥadīth, al-Durr al-Manthūr, and al-Itqān fī ʿUlūm al-Qurʾān.” [Summarized from his biography in al-Badr al-Ṭāliʿ (1/328-335)] The author said, “[I have aimed to produce an interesting book about a special theme]—that being the rationale of the order of the sūrahs—so it can help and save the time of one who is after such knowledge. Most of its content is from my own thoughts, contemplation, and insights since only a few people have touched upon this topic. I have explicitly given reference to that which I used from others, and I would only mention that which is good and would not make me subject to criticism.”"

The Quran was revealed in the Arabic language and it should also be read in Arabic only, because the actual meaning of the Quran in Arabic cannot be expressed in the translation of any language. That is why, it is an established fact that the reading of the any translation of the Quran does not mean that the actual Quran has been recited.

All the praises and thanks are to Allah, the Lord of Al-'Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists) and peace be upon the Master of the Messengers, Muhammad. This interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an has been revised and the following changes have been made Translator Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan Formerly Director, University Hospital Islamic University, Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah Saudi Arabia Islam is the Divine religion for all people on the earth. It is a valuable treasure if they realize its truth. What the whole world needs most today is to understand and study its original sources: the Qur'an and Sunnah, as only Islam can extinguish people's thirst for their knowledge about their Creator; organize their mutual relations on the basis of justice and equality; and respond to human nature in a way that will lead them to happiness in the world as well as in the Hereafter. How many trials and wars are people undergoing due to their differences in beliefs and systems which have caused them to split in utter separation. Now there is no way to peace and security except Islam. Therefore, an invitation to Islam is a duty of those who have known it, enjoyed its taste and have been rightly guided by it. In fact, it is a great responsibility upon Muslims to preach the teachings of Islam to the non-Muslims in their own languages. Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan, a specialist in heart diseases who worked for some time in England, then moved to Saudi Arabia to settle in Al-Madinah AI-Munawwarah, realized his responsibility towards Islam. This was owed to a dream he had one night. According to the dream, he saw the Prophet in a large gathering of people. Out of love, he stepped towards him to kiss his knees; but the Prophet disapproved it. Suddenly, the perspiration began to flow from his body and Muhsin Khan drank it to his satisfaction. Then the Prophet asked him for a paper on which he wrote down that he wanted him (to serve Islam) and stamped it with his seal. When Muhsin Khan woke up, he was struck by a feeling of bewilderment, awe, and sublimity. He asked the knowledgeable persons to interpret his dream. They indicated that he would serve the Prophet's sayings. So, he looked for a project to serve Islam and convey its message to the English-speaking people. After much consideration, he concluded that Sahih of Imam Al-Bukhari, who is the most authentic collector of the Prophet's sayings, needs to be translated into English. So, he decided to render Sahih Al-Bukhari into English. He worked strenuously completing it in twelve years with the Grace of Allah. During the translation process, he consulted a number of English versions of the Qur'an but he found that they had ambiguity, shortcomings, and dogmatic errors. Therefore, in association with Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali, he undertook the task of interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an providing evidence from the authentic sources for clarification. At their behest, we brought about a summarized edition in one volume. Its popularity among the readers encouraged them to prepare a comprehensive version of the interpretation of the meanings of the Qur'an in nine volumes comprising a number of Ahadith from Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim and other books with comments from Tafsir At-Tabari, Tafsir AI-Qurtubi and Tafsir Ibn Kathir, where necessary to elaborate upon the Qur'anic Verses. No doubt this work is a great source of knowledge for the readers, seekers of truth and the scholars. Now, they can study the Qur'an in a better way and concentrate on the wisdom behind it. In this nine-volume edition, the reader will find that the statements on Monotheism, Disbelief, Polytheism, Hypocrisy and Jihad have been repeated several times. This is to highlight the significance of the Islamic creed. Also, some Ahadith has been repeated at various places due to their relevancy and close context with the Verses. Therefore, such repetition has become an unavoidable need for the correct interpretation. Finally, I wish to express my thanks to the translators for their kind permission to bring about this work for the benefit of the people. I am also grateful to my staff members, particularly Syed Masoodul Hasan, Mr. Mohammad Munawwar and Mr. Mohammad Ayub who made their best efforts to check and reuse the text carefully and repeatedly to avoid any mistakes; and thus contributed substantially to give the final touch to the project. May Allah the Almighty reward us for this achievement, make it solely for His Pleasure and hold us firm on the Right Path. May Allah shower peace and blessings on our Prophet Muhammad, his family, Companions and all those who follow him. Abdul Malik MujahidGeneral Manager Darussalam Publishers and Distributors, Riyadh."

The legal Islamic rulings required should be from those who have knowledge of Qur'anic Verses and Hadiths, and be able to understand them and to use them as evidence as required on the questions. They must possess knowledge to the extent that they are able to cite relevant Hadiths on which there is consensus. They must have sufficient knowledge of the Arabic language to understand the texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah and to derive and extract proofs from them.

To understand the Quran it is necessary that one should know the translation of every word of the verse. Therefore, to convey to the people, the more accurate meaning of the Qur'anic verses, the word-for-word translation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an is produced. Since mere word-for-word translation itself does not lead to the complete understanding, the idiomatic translation is also produced on the same page to facilitate for the complete awareness. To understand the Qur'an, it is necessary that one should know the translation of every word of the Verses. It is very difficult to understand the Qur'an without knowledge of the meanings of the Arabic words. Therefore, to overcome this difficulty and to convey to the people the accurate meaning of the Qur'anic Verses, we are producing the word-for-word translation of the meanings of the Noble Qur’an. Since mere word-for-word translation itself does not lead to complete understanding, we have produced the idiomatic translation also in order to allow the readers to see the word-for-word translation of the Arabic Verses along with the idiomatic one on the same page. I remember from my childhood, when I was studying in the fourth grade, my teacher used to teach us the Qur'an along with its Urdu translation. We studied the necessary interpretation and the Arabic grammar. After about three years of study, I was able to recite on my own the first few parts of the Qur'an while understanding its meaning in the Urdu language. Whenever the Imam recited Verses from those parts in the congregational prayers at the mosque, I easily understood the meaning of the Verses. I felt great joy at being able to understand the recitation of the Imam. This memory initiated me to produce this translation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an so that the readers and reciters of the Qur'an may extract more pleasure from the recitation by understanding its meanings. All the present English translations of the meanings of the Qur’an are idiomatic. Such translations are not designed to help the reader learn the meanings of each Arabic word. Therefore, the readers and reciters simply proceed forward without 'knowledge of the Arabic vocabulary used in the Verses. But when one knows the Meanings of each Arabic word of the Verse, then whether he himself recites the Qur’an, or listens to some other's recitation, he gets the pleasure of understanding it. The real marvel of the Qur'an comes with its understanding. The Qur'an itself emphasizes this point: (Surat Al-Qamar, 54:40) Also Allah has encouraged us to contemplate the meanings of the Qur'an. We receive blessings for its recital, but mere recital alone in melodious tone is not the goal of Qur'anic recitation. The intent of reading the Qur'an should be to reflect upon and understand the address of Allah Himself to mankind. Allah says: ""Do they not then think deeply (contemplate) in the Qur'an, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?"" (Surat Muhammad, 47:24) If one approaches the Qur'an with the intent of reflecting upon its meanings, then he achieves the full objective of the Qur’an’s revelation, which is guidance for mankind. As Allah says: ""The month of Ramadan, in which the Qur’an was revealed as a guidance for mankind."" (Surat Al-Baqarah,2:185) It should also be noted that some Islamic scholars have certain reservations about the word-for-word translation, saying that such a translation may cause confusion in the minds of the readers. But other renowned scholars of the Indo-Pak Subcontinent have produced such translations in the Urdu language. The most popular one being done by Shah Rafiuddin, the son of Shah Waliullah. Until now, this translation is considered the best and the most authentic one. Hafiz Nazeer Ahmad, the former principal of Oriental College, Lahore, performed another recent word-for-word translation in the Urdu language. Some other scholars have also contributed in this regard. It may be that the native speakers of Arabic do not give much importance to the word-for-word translation, but they will know its importance if they ask any non-Arab Muslim about it. This will be especially clear after one has gone through this translation of the Qur’an which we have produced. After studying this translation, the native English speaker will relate how pleased he is with his increased understanding of the Qur'anic recitation. I must thank Mr, Aqeel Walker, Mr. Said Dabas, Mr. Syed Masoodul Hasan, Mr. Mohammad Ayub and Mr. Aziz-ur-Rahman who worked on this project. It should be particularly noted that in this compilation, we have produced with all its references, the translation of the interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an done by Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan. We will be thankful for every comment, suggestion or advice by the readers and reciters of the Qur'an, that may help to improve this presentation. Abdul Malik MujahidGeneral Manager"

So, to help those readers and reciters who are not too familiar with the Arabic language or cannot read Arabic, Darussalam has prepared this edition of the Noble Qur'an inserting the transliteration of the Noble verses along with their translation. It is hoped that this presentation will be of great help and benefit in this regard. All praise and thanks are Allah's, the Lord of Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists) and peace be upon the Master of the Messengers, Muhammad (S). This interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an has been revised and the following changes have been made: Translators: & Islam is a heavenly system (or regime) for all the dwellers of the earth, and it is a mighty treasure if only mankind realizes its authenticity and truth. And in what a great need the whole world is today for real understanding and thorough studying of its rules and regulations. And how many disasters, calamities and wars, the mankind of the whole world is suffering because of their differences in their Faith. Invitation to Islam is incumbent upon all those who have known it, and have enjoyed its taste and have been guided through its guidance. So we are presenting the interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an which is completed and printed with the Help of Allah. All praise and thanks are Allah's, with whose blessings are completed the righteous deeds. Peace. Blessings and Graces of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and his Companions. Allah has sent Qur'an to us through His Messenger Muhammad. This Noble Book provides us guidance in all respects whether it is a matter of life or death. It is incumbent upon us to recite the Noble Qur'an as much as we can, and as correct as we can. The Prophet Muhammad; has said: ""The best of you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it."" So, to learn it correctly and teach it correctly, we have to care about the correct pronunciation of the Arabic words. To provide ease with the correct pronunciation of the Arabic words, we are producing this special edition of the Noble Qur'an incorporating in it the transliteration of the Arabic Verses. It is hoped that this edition will help greatly in this regard. Lastly, I thank all the brothers who participated in the accomplishment of this colossal work particularly brother Abdul Ahad and brother Mohammad Munawar who checked and rechecked, again and again, the manuscript with great perseverance.

He was given authorization (ijāzah) by the major scholars of his time from different countries and towns. He excelled in the various sciences and surpassed his peers; he gained distinction and his acclaim spread far and wide. From his beneficial works are his two Jāmiʿ collections of ḥadīth, al-Durr al-Manthūr, and al-Itqān fī ʿUlūm al-Qurʾān.” [Summarized from his biography in al-Badr al-Ṭāliʿ (1/328-335)] The author said, “[I have aimed to produce an interesting book about a special theme]—that being the rationale of the order of the sūrahs—so it can help and save the time of one who is after such knowledge.

A summarized version of At-Tabari, Al-Qurtubi and Ibn Kathir with comments from Sahih Al-Bukhari. The reading or the Quran is of prime importance to a Muslim. The Quran was revealed in the Arabic language and it should also be read in Arabic only, because the actual meaning of the Quran in Arabic cannot be expressed in the translation of any language. That is why, it is an established fact that the reading of the any translation of the Quran does not mean that the actual Quran has been recited. But the Muslim who cannot read Arabic, are unable to get benefit by reciting the Quran in its language. Te ease them from this difficulty, through transliteration, an easy approach has been presented to recite the Quran. We have prepared this part of the Quran first which is in fact the last part of the Quran and contains small chapters (Surah)."

This 9 volume version offers commentary and complete hadith in Arabic and English related to the verse. This unique combination of commentary and relevant Ahadith makes this a very useful study reference tool. The Arabic text is taken from Mushaf al-Madinah. All the praises and thanks are to Allah, the Lord of Al-'Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists) and peace be upon the Master of the Messengers, Muhammad. This interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an has been revised and the following changes have been made Translator Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan Formerly Director, University Hospital Islamic University, Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah Saudi Arabia Islam is the Divine religion for all people on the earth. It is a valuable treasure if they realize its truth. What the whole world needs most today is to understand and study its original sources: the Qur'an and Sunnah, as only Islam can extinguish people's thirst for their knowledge about their Creator; organize their mutual relations on the basis of justice and equality; and respond to human nature in a way that will lead them to happiness in the world as well as in the Hereafter. How many trials and wars are people undergoing due to their differences in beliefs and systems which have caused them to split in utter separation. Now there is no way to peace and security except Islam. Therefore, an invitation to Islam is a duty of those who have known it, enjoyed its taste and have been rightly guided by it. In fact, it is a great responsibility upon Muslims to preach the teachings of Islam to the non-Muslims in their own languages. Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan, a specialist in heart diseases who worked for some time in England, then moved to Saudi Arabia to settle in Al-Madinah AI-Munawwarah, realized his responsibility towards Islam. This was owed to a dream he had one night. According to the dream, he saw the Prophet in a large gathering of people. Out of love, he stepped towards him to kiss his knees; but the Prophet disapproved it. Suddenly, the perspiration began to flow from his body and Muhsin Khan drank it to his satisfaction. Then the Prophet asked him for a paper on which he wrote down that he wanted him (to serve Islam) and stamped it with his seal. When Muhsin Khan woke up, he was struck by a feeling of bewilderment, awe, and sublimity. He asked the knowledgeable persons to interpret his dream. They indicated that he would serve the Prophet's sayings. So, he looked for a project to serve Islam and convey its message to the English-speaking people. After much consideration, he concluded that Sahih of Imam Al-Bukhari, who is the most authentic collector of the Prophet's sayings, needs to be translated into English. So, he decided to render Sahih Al-Bukhari into English. He worked strenuously completing it in twelve years with the Grace of Allah. During the translation process, he consulted a number of English versions of the Qur'an but he found that they had ambiguity, shortcomings, and dogmatic errors. Therefore, in association with Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali, he undertook the task of interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an providing evidence from the authentic sources for clarification. At their behest, we brought about a summarized edition in one volume. Its popularity among the readers encouraged them to prepare a comprehensive version of the interpretation of the meanings of the Qur'an in nine volumes comprising a number of Ahadith from Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim and other books with comments from Tafsir At-Tabari, Tafsir AI-Qurtubi and Tafsir Ibn Kathir, where necessary to elaborate upon the Qur'anic Verses. No doubt this work is a great source of knowledge for the readers, seekers of truth and the scholars. Now, they can study the Qur'an in a better way and concentrate on the wisdom behind it. In this nine-volume edition, the reader will find that the statements on Monotheism, Disbelief, Polytheism, Hypocrisy and Jihad have been repeated several times. This is to highlight the significance of the Islamic creed. Also, some Ahadith has been repeated at various places due to their relevancy and close context with the Verses. Therefore, such repetition has become an unavoidable need for the correct interpretation. Finally, I wish to express my thanks to the translators for their kind permission to bring about this work for the benefit of the people. I am also grateful to my staff members, particularly Syed Masoodul Hasan, Mr. Mohammad Munawwar and Mr. Mohammad Ayub who made their best efforts to check and reuse the text carefully and repeatedly to avoid any mistakes; and thus contributed substantially to give the final touch to the project. May Allah the Almighty reward us for this achievement, make it solely for His Pleasure and hold us firm on the Right Path. May Allah shower peace and blessings on our Prophet Muhammad, his family, Companions and all those who follow him. Abdul Malik MujahidGeneral Manager Darussalam Publishers and Distributors, Riyadh."

Since mere word-for-word translation itself does not lead to the complete understanding, the idiomatic translation is also produced on the same page to facilitate for the complete awareness. To understand the Qur'an, it is necessary that one should know the translation of every word of the Verses. It is very difficult to understand the Qur'an without knowledge of the meanings of the Arabic words. Therefore, to overcome this difficulty and to convey to the people the accurate meaning of the Qur'anic Verses, we are producing the word-for-word translation of the meanings of the Noble Qur’an. Since mere word-for-word translation itself does not lead to complete understanding, we have produced the idiomatic translation also in order to allow the readers to see the word-for-word translation of the Arabic Verses along with the idiomatic one on the same page. I remember from my childhood, when I was studying in the fourth grade, my teacher used to teach us the Qur'an along with its Urdu translation. We studied the necessary interpretation and the Arabic grammar. After about three years of study, I was able to recite on my own the first few parts of the Qur'an while understanding its meaning in the Urdu language. Whenever the Imam recited Verses from those parts in the congregational prayers at the mosque, I easily understood the meaning of the Verses. I felt great joy at being able to understand the recitation of the Imam. This memory initiated me to produce this translation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an so that the readers and reciters of the Qur'an may extract more pleasure from the recitation by understanding its meanings. All the present English translations of the meanings of the Qur’an are idiomatic. Such translations are not designed to help the reader learn the meanings of each Arabic word. Therefore, the readers and reciters simply proceed forward without 'knowledge of the Arabic vocabulary used in the Verses. But when one knows the Meanings of each Arabic word of the Verse, then whether he himself recites the Qur’an, or listens to some other's recitation, he gets the pleasure of understanding it. The real marvel of the Qur'an comes with its understanding. The Qur'an itself emphasizes this point: (Surat Al-Qamar, 54:40) Also Allah has encouraged us to contemplate the meanings of the Qur'an. We receive blessings for its recital, but mere recital alone in melodious tone is not the goal of Qur'anic recitation. The intent of reading the Qur'an should be to reflect upon and understand the address of Allah Himself to mankind. Allah says: ""Do they not then think deeply (contemplate) in the Qur'an, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?"" (Surat Muhammad, 47:24) If one approaches the Qur'an with the intent of reflecting upon its meanings, then he achieves the full objective of the Qur’an’s revelation, which is guidance for mankind. As Allah says: ""The month of Ramadan, in which the Qur’an was revealed as a guidance for mankind."" (Surat Al-Baqarah,2:185) It should also be noted that some Islamic scholars have certain reservations about the word-for-word translation, saying that such a translation may cause confusion in the minds of the readers. But other renowned scholars of the Indo-Pak Subcontinent have produced such translations in the Urdu language. The most popular one being done by Shah Rafiuddin, the son of Shah Waliullah. Until now, this translation is considered the best and the most authentic one. Hafiz Nazeer Ahmad, the former principal of Oriental College, Lahore, performed another recent word-for-word translation in the Urdu language. Some other scholars have also contributed in this regard. It may be that the native speakers of Arabic do not give much importance to the word-for-word translation, but they will know its importance if they ask any non-Arab Muslim about it. This will be especially clear after one has gone through this translation of the Qur’an which we have produced. After studying this translation, the native English speaker will relate how pleased he is with his increased understanding of the Qur'anic recitation. I must thank Mr, Aqeel Walker, Mr. Said Dabas, Mr. Syed Masoodul Hasan, Mr. Mohammad Ayub and Mr. Aziz-ur-Rahman who worked on this project. It should be particularly noted that in this compilation, we have produced with all its references, the translation of the interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an done by Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan. We will be thankful for every comment, suggestion or advice by the readers and reciters of the Qur'an, that may help to improve this presentation. Abdul Malik MujahidGeneral Manager"

All praise and thanks are Allah's, the Lord of Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists) and peace be upon the Master of the Messengers, Muhammad (S). This interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an has been revised and the following changes have been made: Translators: & Islam is a heavenly system (or regime) for all the dwellers of the earth, and it is a mighty treasure if only mankind realizes its authenticity and truth. And in what a great need the whole world is today for real understanding and thorough studying of its rules and regulations. And how many disasters, calamities and wars, the mankind of the whole world is suffering because of their differences in their Faith. Invitation to Islam is incumbent upon all those who have known it, and have enjoyed its taste and have been guided through its guidance. So we are presenting the interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an which is completed and printed with the Help of Allah. All praise and thanks are Allah's, with whose blessings are completed the righteous deeds. Peace. Blessings and Graces of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and his Companions. Allah has sent Qur'an to us through His Messenger Muhammad. This Noble Book provides us guidance in all respects whether it is a matter of life or death. It is incumbent upon us to recite the Noble Qur'an as much as we can, and as correct as we can. The Prophet Muhammad; has said: ""The best of you is he who learns the Qur'an and teaches it."" So, to learn it correctly and teach it correctly, we have to care about the correct pronunciation of the Arabic words. To provide ease with the correct pronunciation of the Arabic words, we are producing this special edition of the Noble Qur'an incorporating in it the transliteration of the Arabic Verses. It is hoped that this edition will help greatly in this regard. Lastly, I thank all the brothers who participated in the accomplishment of this colossal work particularly brother Abdul Ahad and brother Mohammad Munawar who checked and rechecked, again and again, the manuscript with great perseverance.

From the back cover: Qatādah (d. 118) said, “By Allah, they would find in the Qurʾan that which would impede sinfulness, if only they contemplated upon it and comprehended it.” [Tafsīr al-Ṭabarī] Al-Shawkānī (d. 1250) said, “Al-Suyūṭī was a major imām and a prolific author. He was given authorization (ijāzah) by the major scholars of his time from different countries and towns. He excelled in the various sciences and surpassed his peers; he gained distinction and his acclaim spread far and wide. From his beneficial works are his two Jāmiʿ collections of ḥadīth, al-Durr al-Manthūr, and al-Itqān fī ʿUlūm al-Qurʾān.” [Summarized from his biography in al-Badr al-Ṭāliʿ (1/328-335)] The author said, “[I have aimed to produce an interesting book about a special theme]—that being the rationale of the order of the sūrahs—so it can help and save the time of one who is after such knowledge. Most of its content is from my own thoughts, contemplation, and insights since only a few people have touched upon this topic.

The Quran was revealed in the Arabic language and it should also be read in Arabic only, because the actual meaning of the Quran in Arabic cannot be expressed in the translation of any language. That is why, it is an established fact that the reading of the any translation of the Quran does not mean that the actual Quran has been recited.

This 9 volume version offers commentary and complete hadith in Arabic and English related to the verse. This unique combination of commentary and relevant Ahadith makes this a very useful study reference tool. The Arabic text is taken from Mushaf al-Madinah. All the praises and thanks are to Allah, the Lord of Al-'Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists) and peace be upon the Master of the Messengers, Muhammad. This interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an has been revised and the following changes have been made Translator Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan Formerly Director, University Hospital Islamic University, Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah Saudi Arabia Islam is the Divine religion for all people on the earth. It is a valuable treasure if they realize its truth. What the whole world needs most today is to understand and study its original sources: the Qur'an and Sunnah, as only Islam can extinguish people's thirst for their knowledge about their Creator; organize their mutual relations on the basis of justice and equality; and respond to human nature in a way that will lead them to happiness in the world as well as in the Hereafter. How many trials and wars are people undergoing due to their differences in beliefs and systems which have caused them to split in utter separation. Now there is no way to peace and security except Islam. Therefore, an invitation to Islam is a duty of those who have known it, enjoyed its taste and have been rightly guided by it. In fact, it is a great responsibility upon Muslims to preach the teachings of Islam to the non-Muslims in their own languages. Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan, a specialist in heart diseases who worked for some time in England, then moved to Saudi Arabia to settle in Al-Madinah AI-Munawwarah, realized his responsibility towards Islam. This was owed to a dream he had one night. According to the dream, he saw the Prophet in a large gathering of people. Out of love, he stepped towards him to kiss his knees; but the Prophet disapproved it. Suddenly, the perspiration began to flow from his body and Muhsin Khan drank it to his satisfaction. Then the Prophet asked him for a paper on which he wrote down that he wanted him (to serve Islam) and stamped it with his seal. When Muhsin Khan woke up, he was struck by a feeling of bewilderment, awe, and sublimity. He asked the knowledgeable persons to interpret his dream. They indicated that he would serve the Prophet's sayings. So, he looked for a project to serve Islam and convey its message to the English-speaking people. After much consideration, he concluded that Sahih of Imam Al-Bukhari, who is the most authentic collector of the Prophet's sayings, needs to be translated into English. So, he decided to render Sahih Al-Bukhari into English. He worked strenuously completing it in twelve years with the Grace of Allah. During the translation process, he consulted a number of English versions of the Qur'an but he found that they had ambiguity, shortcomings, and dogmatic errors. Therefore, in association with Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali, he undertook the task of interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an providing evidence from the authentic sources for clarification. At their behest, we brought about a summarized edition in one volume. Its popularity among the readers encouraged them to prepare a comprehensive version of the interpretation of the meanings of the Qur'an in nine volumes comprising a number of Ahadith from Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim and other books with comments from Tafsir At-Tabari, Tafsir AI-Qurtubi and Tafsir Ibn Kathir, where necessary to elaborate upon the Qur'anic Verses. No doubt this work is a great source of knowledge for the readers, seekers of truth and the scholars. Now, they can study the Qur'an in a better way and concentrate on the wisdom behind it. In this nine-volume edition, the reader will find that the statements on Monotheism, Disbelief, Polytheism, Hypocrisy and Jihad have been repeated several times. This is to highlight the significance of the Islamic creed. Also, some Ahadith has been repeated at various places due to their relevancy and close context with the Verses. Therefore, such repetition has become an unavoidable need for the correct interpretation. Finally, I wish to express my thanks to the translators for their kind permission to bring about this work for the benefit of the people. I am also grateful to my staff members, particularly Syed Masoodul Hasan, Mr. Mohammad Munawwar and Mr. Mohammad Ayub who made their best efforts to check and reuse the text carefully and repeatedly to avoid any mistakes; and thus contributed substantially to give the final touch to the project. May Allah the Almighty reward us for this achievement, make it solely for His Pleasure and hold us firm on the Right Path. May Allah shower peace and blessings on our Prophet Muhammad, his family, Companions and all those who follow him. Abdul Malik MujahidGeneral Manager Darussalam Publishers and Distributors, Riyadh."

The legal Islamic rulings required should be from those who have knowledge of Qur'anic Verses and Hadiths, and be able to understand them and to use them as evidence as required on the questions. They must possess knowledge to the extent that they are able to cite relevant Hadiths on which there is consensus. They must have sufficient knowledge of the Arabic language to understand the texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah and to derive and extract proofs from them. It is not easy for the Muslims to contact such learned scholars of Islam at all times for legal judgements they are in need of at particular times. To overcome this difficulty of the Muslims, Darussalam is presenting this collection of legal rulings issued from the most renowned scholars of the world.

The author provides proofs from the Quran, Sunnah & beliefs of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah regarding the torment and bliss of the grave, and how it differs from the belief of the misguided groups from amongst the people of innovation and desires. The grave is the first stage that the slave proceeds to after the worldly life. In it, the people of Al-Barzakh Will find What they deserve of torment or bliss, depending on their state in the dunya, and then to Heaven or the Hell-fire, and therein will reside in the never-ending residence. May Allah save us from His punishment and make us from among the righteous who increase in good deeds until they obtain His mercy. Ameen. It is related that Abu Hurairah said: ""We were walking with the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) when we passed two graves. Then he stood still and we stood with him. His color started to change and he rolled up his sleeves, so we said: 'What's the matter, oh Prophet of Allah?', he said: 'Don't you hear what I'm hearing?' We said: 'What is it, oh Prophet of Allah?' He said: 'These two men are being severely punished in their graves for a relatively minir sin."" We said: 'For what are they punished, oh Prophet of Allah?' He said: 'One of them never used to clean urine from himself, and the other used to harm the people by his speech and walk amongst the people carrying tales.' So he called for two palm stalks and he put one into each grave. We said: 'Will this benefit them oh Messenger of Allah?' He replied: 'Yes, it will lighten their punishment for as long as it remains moist.'"" Reported by Abu Hatim (3/106) in ""Al-Ihsan""."

This is the speech of our Prophet (Sallahu alayhi wa salam). O noble Muslim, in these two tremendous hadeeth are an indication of a tremendous painful punishment that is being saved with Allah for the sinners, as well as a difficult distressful torment that is being saved with the Lord of the worlds for the disobedient. Take heed. What is astonishing is he who laughs and his heart is at ease, and he is falling into sin and he does not know where his end will be. What are amazing are us, O brothers? How are we heedless about that which is waiting for us? Glorified is Allah, did not we read the Quran? Of course; by Allah, did not we read the Sunnah? Certainly; therefore, what is wrong with us? Indeed, there is a barrier between understanding the Quran and the Quran entering the hearts, and between our hearts. There are barriers of sins that have blocked the Quran from entering the hearts. “Do they not reflect about the Quran? Or, are (their) hearts closed up?” * Shaykh Al-Allaamah Abdul Azeez Ibn Baaz (The Obligation of Protecting Yourself and Family from the Fire). * Shaykh Abdullah Bin Uthmaan Ath-Thamaaree (The fire, it lets nothing remain and leaves nothing [unburnt])."

Furthermore, they believe that being ignorant of this topic is not harmful at all. However, I am not delving into something distant. Humans today spend billions of dollars with which they could build cities or countries and end poverty in the farthest reaches of the world -- and, instead, they spend that money on research to discover if there is life or if life is possible on nearby planets. Scientists spend a great deal of their time and resources on such a question. What about an existence that is known to be living and thinking, and that lives right here with us on our earth? They live in our houses and they eat and drink with us. In fact, they even spoil our thoughts and our hearts. They drive us to destroy our own selves and to spill each others' blood. No price can be put on the importance of the texts of the Qur'an and authentic hadith that have reached us, giving us knowledge of this matter.

Allah has placed before the Final Hour certain signs that indicate how close it actually is. Indeed, our Prophet considered the approaching of the Final Hour as something very great, such that whenever he mentioned it, his cheeks would become red, his voice would rise and his irritation would intensify. He would always speak of it and give reminders concerning it. The Companions would often reflect upon the matter of the Final Hour. Huthaifah said: ""The Prophet (S) came upon us while we were reminding each other. So he said: 'What are you all discussing?'"" We replied: 'We are reminding each other of the Final Hour.' When the Prophet began to mention it often and the Verses concerning its approach became numerous, the Companions feared that its occurrence would befall them (i.e., in their lifetime). Many of the signs of the Final Hour have already appeared and much of what the Prophet informed (us) of has manifested itself. Therefore, every passing day increases the believers in their Faith and belief in Prophet Muhammad. This is due to the appearance of signs of his Prophet-hood and proofs of his truthfulness, all of which require the Muslims to adhere to this upright religion so that they may be prepared for this event. For verily, the Hour has drawn near and its signs have become apparent. Allah the Exalted said: ""The Hour has drawn near and the moon has been split."" (54:1) One of the wise people once said: ""I am amazed at the one who feels grief over the loss of his wealth but yet he does not feel grief over the loss of his life span (which occurs daily)."" So strive hard in worship (of Allah), weep over your sins and flee from the punishment (in the Hereafter). The victorious one is he who directs his hopes toward that which is everlasting and cuts off his aspirations for that which is temporary. When Muhammad bin Sirin was about to die, he wept. It was said to him: ""Why are you weeping?"" He replied: ""I am weeping due to my lapses in the days that have passed and the small number of deeds that I performed seeking the lofty Paradise."""

(Are these) like those who shall dwell forever in the Fire and be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels?"" [(V47:15) The Noble Qur'an] In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. For the salvation of all mankind and jinn from the punishment in the Hell-fire, I have decided to write this Book: ""Road to Paradise."" It is a collection of Qur'anic Verses and the narrations of Allah's Messenger that concerns about Paradise. Narrated Abu Hurairah (R): Allah's Messenger said, ""The (Hell) Fire is surrounded by all kinds of desires and passions, while Paradise is surrounded by all kinds of disliked undesirable things."" (Inordinate desires and animalistic passions lead to the Fire while self-control, perseverance, chastity and all other virtues, and the obedience to Allah and His Messenger lead to Paradise. What leads to Hell is easy to do while what leads to Paradise is difficult to do.) (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No. 495) So, the Road to Paradise is full of hurdles and pits, and not so easy to go through it! It needs great patience, self-control, and to avoid all evil deeds such as illegal sex, illegal talk (like backbiting, telling lies, etc.), illegal foods and drinks; and to perform regularly compulsory congregational prayers, fasting, Jihad (holy fighting in Allah's cause), and to give obligatory charity (Zakat), and to perform Umrah and Hajj. All glory and praise is to Allah, the One to Whom all dignity, honor and respect are due; the Unique with perfect attributes, Who begets not, nor is He begotten. He has no equal but He is the All-Mighty, Omnipotent. He sent His Messengers and Prophets to guide humanity towards Monotheism, to worship Him Alone, the only One Worthy of worship, and to warn them of the eternal dire consequences of polytheism, associating partners with One Allah and the worship of creatures. All the Prophets preached Monotheism, the Belief in the Oneness of Allah, the Glorious, the Elevated. As the Statement of Allah, the Blessed, the Most High: ""Indeed, We sent Nuh (Noah) to his people and he said: 'O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilah (God) but Him. (La ilaha illallah: none has the right to be worshipped but Allah.) Certainly, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day!""' (V7:59) ""And to 'Ad (people, We sent) their brother Hud.

(V7:85) ""And to Thamud (people, We sent) their brother Salih. He said: 'O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilah (God) but Him. (La ilaha illallah: none has the right to be worshipped but Allah).""' (V7:73) ""And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): 'Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities, i.e., do not worship anything besides Allah).""' (V 16:36) a) It has been narrated by Abu Hurairah (R) * in the Hadith Books (At Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Abu Dawud) that the Prophet said: ""The Jews and Christians were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two religious sects, and this nation will be divided into seventy-three religious sects - all in Hell, except one, and that one is the one on which I and my Companions are today [i.e., following the Qur'an and the Prophet's Sunnah (legal ways, orders, acts of worship and statements of the Prophet )]."" b) ""Nor would he order you to take angels and Prophets for lords (gods).* Would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to Allah's Will?"" (Tafsir At-Tabari) (V.3:80) * Narrated 'Umar (R): 1 heard the Prophet saying, ""Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the son of Maryam (Mary),** for I am only a slave.

This is an affair which is possible, and its evil and fitnah are to be feared. The need of the slave for having protection from his fitnah, by all means, is something known. And from the greatest means is seeking refuge with Allāh from him. Also, this is through supplication and fearing his fitnah. Thus, it is inevitable that one does so in all levels of this ummah. This is a firmly placed ‘aqīdah, to the point that if it occurred and its occurrence is actualized, then this ummah—specifically those who have a connection to the correct and sound belief system—will be able to defend itself from this evil and be protected from his fitnah. In contrast, if the fear of him were to be removed from the hearts, then the fitnah would be increased when that time comes. And the believers would have no tangible īmān to eradicate his fitnah and evil."

It was honored by the World Muslim League as first prize winner book. Whoever wants to know the whole life style of the Prophet in detail must read this book. Muhammad (S) is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him, are severe against the disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (fore heads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurah (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (Paradise). (Al-Fath: 29) The Prophet Muhammad (S) said: ""The example of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth. Some of which was fertile soil that absorbed rain-water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain-water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking (making their animals drink from it) and to irrigate the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's Religion (Islam) and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah (Azawajal) has revealed through me (the Prophet) and learns and then teaches it to others. The (last example is that of a) person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's Guidance revealed through me (he is like that barren land)."" (Al-Mukarramah) The heart of every Muslim is filled with love for the last Prophet Muhammad (S) and this love of the messenger of Allah is an asset for him. Love and respect of a person depends on the benefits we get from him, As the Prophet , is the greatest benefactor of humanity, every Muslim has deepest love for him, Every deed of his life is to be followed by every individual of the Muslim Ummah. Highest love for the Prophet (S) is made a test of our Faith. Allah the All-Mighty has described and explained the status of Muhammad (S) in the Qur'an: ""Say (O Muhammad (S) to mankind): If you (really) love Allah then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic monotheism, follow the Qur'an and the Sunnah), Allah will love you..."" (3:31) Love of Allah's Messenger (S) is a part of our Faith. There is a Hadith (narration) of the Prophet (S) who said: ""None of you has Faith unless I am dearer to him than his father and his son and all mankind."" In the early period of Islam, many books were written on the life of the Prophet (S) in the Qur'an itself, the best example of the life of Muhammad (S), has also been mentioned, The Qur'an says: ""And verily, you (O Muhammad (S) are on an exalted standard of character."" (68:4) Someone asked 'Aishah (R) about the noble character and manners of the Prophet (S). She answered: ""Have you not read the Qur'an? His character is a complete explanation of the Qur'an."" It means that whatever is commanded and prohibited in the Qur'an, its practical example is present in the manners of Muhammad In other words, the ideal and perfect example of good manners and character which the Qur'an demands from mankind, was present in the person of Muhammad in its highest degree. Scholars of Ahadith (traditions) and writers of the biography of Muhammad , the Messenger of Allah, have explored his life from every angle and aspect from birth to death. Every event, every incident of his life has been described and narrated, but none had claimed that he has given his life's recording its full rights. Hundreds of books have been written on the life of Muhammad and this endeavor will continue till the Day of Resurrection. No doubt The Sealed Nectar (Ar-Raheeq AI-Makhturn) is a book of great value and praiseworthy work on the life of Muhammad. This book has been written by the Eminent Shaikh Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri of Jamiah Salafiyah, Banaras (India). The first Islamic Conference on Seerah (biography of the Prophet) was held in 1976 in Pakistan sponsored by the Muslim World League. The League announced a world contest for writing a book on the life of the Prophet. One hundred fifty thousand Saudi Riyals (SR 150,000) (forty thousand U.S. Dollars) was the grand prize for the best five books. One hundred and seventy-one manuscripts were received from all over the world. Out of these, eighty-five were in the Arabic Language, sixty-four in Urdu, twenty-one were in English and one in French and Hausa. A board of highly qualified scholars judged the manuscripts and announced the results. The manuscript of Shaikh Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, Jamiah Salafiyah Banaras (India), author of the book in hand (The Sealed Nectar) received first the grand prize of SR 50,000 (fifty thousand Saudi Riyals) for its authentic and sound collections of the narrations. Dr. Majid Ali Khan, New Delhi, India, placed second. The third prize went to Dr. Naseer Ahmed, Islamic University, Lahore, Pakistan. The fourth prize was awarded to Mr. Harnid Mahmud of Egypt. The fifth and final prize was awarded to Abdus-Salam Hashim of Madinah Munawwarah. An extravagant prize distribution ceremony was held at Makkah Al-Mukarramah on 12 Rabi'ul-Awwal 1399 A.H. (1979 C.E.). Afterwards, the book was published by the Muslim World League and then many other organizations gained the honor of publishing this masterpiece. Darussalam also published this book in the Arabic language. I had wished to publish this book in the English language for the wider benefit of humanity. Shaikh Safiur-Rahman willingly agreed to the idea and consented to publish the English translation. The stage of translation was traversed with the help of brother Mahir Abu Dhahab, owner and general manager of Markaz Noor Ash-Sham in Damascus, Syria. For the first edition of this book, brother Mahir Abu Dhahab from Syria, Damascus, provided his help and cooperation as regards the translation work for which I offer my special thanks to him. Now in your hands is the new revised edition with many changes and additions. Brother Abu Khaliyl (U.S.A.) amended and improved the translation to make its language simple and easy, besides comparing again from the beginning to the end the English translation with the Arabic revised text to update the changes therein. So, after a coherent toil of months, this edition was published. (All praise is for Allah). The opinions and views from the readers concerning this edition will be appreciated.

The stories of the prophets and all the events in their lives have been supported by the Qur'anic Verses and the Sunnah (traditions) of the Prophet (S). Wherever it was necessary, other sources have also been reported for the sake of historical accounts, but on such places a comparative study has been made to prove the authenticity of the sources. Ibn Kathir has reproduced the views and interpretations of all the great exegetes of the Qur'an of his time. The systemic narratives of the Stories of the Prophets have been written in chronological order which renders a historical style to the book. Allah the Most Exalted says in the Qur'an:"
